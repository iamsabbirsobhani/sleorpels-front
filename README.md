# SLEORPELS Front End

### SLEORPELS is my proof of concept or a portfolio project. There is no existance of this shop in real world.

<span style="color: yellow;" >**SLEORPELS** Backend has hosted in <span style="color: orangered; font-weight: bold;">Azure F1 Shared infrastructure.</span> Which is a free **app service** provied by the Microsoft Azure. This **app service** automatically shut down, when there is no activity running. When it gets request from clients, it wakes up automatically, but it takes some time to wake up. The reason I elaborate the process is because, when you visit this site it is possible that you would see no content for that moment, but after some reload/refresh and when the Azure virtual machine wakes up, you would access the full site normally. Also, it makes no sense I host the backend with 24h service with bunch of money, just to proof of concept/portfolio projects.
